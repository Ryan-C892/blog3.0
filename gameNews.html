                    The first trailer to announce Ubisoft's upcoming <i>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</i> has been released showcasing a new entry to the franchise set during the age of vikings. The CGI trailer begins with the the voice of a man narrating the vikings as violent barbarians while showing said vikings along with the main chracter doing the exact opposite. The narrater is Anglo-Saxon, people who have a real history of conflict with the vikings centuries ago. He states that they need to speak with them "in a language that they understand". The trailer next shows a battle between vikings and anglo-saxons. The main character, named Eivor, sees an older viking get cut down. He rushes to save him only for it to be too late. Eivor then faces the Anglo-Saxon's best warrior. When the battle turns against him, he uses the iconic hidden blade to win. The game promises a choice between a male or female Eivor with customization options both cosmetic and gameplay changing in scope. The player can make alliances, decide how to combat enemies, and change the world with dialogue choices.
                    <i>Assasin's Creed Valhalla</i> will release on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC and Stadia.</p>

        <h3>Bionicle: Quest for Mata Nui recently announced</h3>
        <h4>May 1st, 2020</h4>
      <div class="flex-container">
          <div class="box">
              <p><img src="https://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/74/73559/thumb_620x2000/9_2.png" alt="Bionicle: Quest for Mata Nui Screenshot" />In recent weeks a new fan-made project has been revealed that plans to revive a long lost line of <b>LEGO</b> toys. During the early 2000's <b>LEGO</b> intruduced the world to <i>Bionicle</i>, a line of buildable action figures with a history that stretched over a decade long before cancellation. For many who remeber Bionicle the main thing that set it apart from other <b>LEGO</b> products was its marketing campaign that featured a simple yet captivating narrative to go along with each toy. This was conveyed through CDs, flash games, and comic books. <i>Bionicle</i> was incredibly popular during it's time, garnering a fanbase that still remains nostalgic for it to this day.
                  <i>Bionicle: Quest for Mata Nui</i> is advertised as an open-world rpg with plenty of exploration, quests and non-playable characters to offer. It also promises a dynamic combat system with an emphasis on combos and the unique powers of collectable masks found throughout the environment.
                  The project has been in development for six years with a developer named "Crainy" leading the charge. His <a href= "https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bionicle-quest-for-mata-nui-revives-franchise-fan-made-game">interview</a> highlights his history working on the game among other topics.
              Overall, I'm very excited for this project. I recall enjoying Bionicle during my childhood and I hope this project can bring this lost era back to life.</p>

            <h3>About this blog</h3>
            <div class= "box">
            <p>I've always enjoyed role playing games for as long as I can remember. I don't think there is any specific reason for this facination for the genre. If I would nail it down to one reason I would say it is because there is always a level of freedom that iss nowhere to be found in most genres. When creating this blog I felt it was best to focus on the role playing genre in order to stand out from other gaming bloggers. I will provide my thoughts on past and current role playing games as well as the latest news in the gaming world. I will also post the occassional guide for the hardest sections of any role playing game. I hope this blog will become an endearing experience for all who visit.</p>

            <p>I'm Ryan Hetherington and I'm a blogger with an interest for sharing my passion for gaming.</p>
            <p>In 2009 I graduated from high school and since then,  I've been looking for a career anywhere I could. I've been in and out of college and manual labor for the past decade. Recently I took to learning web development as it seemed fun and working from home has its advantages. I decided to dedicate myself towards blogging and combine it with my personal interests. I hope that the skills I learn pay off in the future, and I hope that I can deliver the best content for gamers everywhere.</p>
