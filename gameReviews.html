        <h3>Nioh 2</h3>
        <h4>May 2nd, 2020</h4>
      <div class="flex-container">
          <div class="box">
              <p>While I may not have had experience playing the first <i>Nioh</i> game I have heard great praise for it from both the online and word-of-mouth. The sequel has plenty of new features as well as slight improvements to old features. The biggest difference from the first game is the new customizable protagonist. 
                  The story, lore and characters of the game do help carry the experience without being dragged down by the silent avatar players control. The somewhat historical adventure is fused with supernatural elements in a way that is similar to the original. The combat is as intence and as difficult as before. Anyone familiar with titles like <i>Dark Souls</i> can find a challenging fight to be the main draw for this game. Resource management can mean the difference between vicotry and defeat. The new limit breaker named Yokai Shift allows the player to become one of three forms of powerful demons: Brute, Feral, and Phantom. Each form has its own playstyle to chose from such as ranged or close quarters. The new Burst Counter works in similar fashion to a parry making it a common tactic for players to employ. Skill trees are divded into thirteen trees: one for each weapon type, one for magic, one for stealth, one for general fighting abilities, and one for Yokai Shift abilities. Using abilities and spells in combat allows for further progression into a tree and unlocking new skills depending on the skill tree tied to said abilities and spells. There is much more freedom to play around with each skill tree and come up with a new cool build to pummel your enemies. Other improvements include: larger level designs, smart enemy placements and patterns, and greater tension while ttraversing the environment. Boss battles are intense, leaving little room for error and taking a great deal of practice to master. assistance can be found in the form of Benevolent Graves: a freindly blue non-playable chracter that can be summoned to fight for the player. Players can also place down graves to assist other players. Overall, This is a little that has been done to improve from the last game, but that isn't really a bad thing. <i>Nioh 2</i> is a great challenge for any role-playing enthusiast and only improves upon what was already done well the last time around.</p>

            <h3>About this blog</h3>
            <div class= "box">
            <p>I've always enjoyed role playing games for as long as I can remember. I don't think there is any specific reason for this facination for the genre. If I would nail it down to one reason I would say it is because there is always a level of freedom that iss nowhere to be found in most genres. When creating this blog I felt it was best to focus on the role playing genre in order to stand out from other gaming bloggers. I will provide my thoughts on past and current role playing games as well as the latest news in the gaming world. I will also post the occassional guide for the hardest sections of any role playing game. I hope this blog will become an endearing experience for all who visit.</p>

            <p>I'm Ryan Hetherington and I'm a blogger with an interest for sharing my passion for gaming.</p>
            <p>In 2009 I graduated from high school and since then,  I've been looking for a career anywhere I could. I've been in and out of college and manual labor for the past decade. Recently I took to learning web development as it seemed fun and working from home has its advantages. I decided to dedicate myself towards blogging and combine it with my personal interests. I hope that the skills I learn pay off in the future, and I hope that I can deliver the best content for gamers everywhere.</p>
